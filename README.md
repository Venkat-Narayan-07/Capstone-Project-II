# complete End-to-end Jenkins CI/CD pipeline using Git, Terraform, Ansible, Docker and Kubernates.

**Project Overview**

This project demonstrates the implementation of a comprehensive CI/CD pipeline using Git, Terraform, Ansible, Docker, and Kubernetes to automate software deployment, scaling, and operations across a Kubernetes cluster.

**Challenges Addressed**
* Increasing Demand: The company required a platform to handle increased demand for their product, which utilized Docker containers.
* Monolithic Architecture: Previously, they used a monolithic architecture with manual deployments.
* Version Control: Implementing a Git workflow for version control and controlled releases.

**Solution Implemented**
* CI/CD Pipeline: A Jenkins pipeline automates the entire deployment lifecycle.
* Git Integration: Version control is implemented with Git, triggering builds on commits to the master branch.
* Dockerization: Dockerfiles containerize the application code for deployment.
* Kubernetes Deployment: Containerized code gets deployed on a Kubernetes cluster with two replicas.
* NodePort Service: A NodePort service exposes the application on port 30008.
* Infrastructure Provisioning: Terraform manages infrastructure creation on AWS.
* Configuration Management: Ansible deploys necessary software and configurations on servers.

**Key Technologies**
* CI/CD Tool: Jenkins
* Version Control: Git
* Infrastructure Provisioning: Terraform
* Configuration Management: Ansible
* Containerization: Docker
* Container Orchestration: Kubernetes

**Skills Demonstrated**
* CI/CD Pipeline Design and Implementation
* Git Integration for Version Control
* Dockerfile Creation and Containerization
* Kubernetes Deployment and Management
* Infrastructure Provisioning with Terraform
* Configuration Management with Ansible

**Project Outcomes**
* Automated Deployment: Streamlined the deployment process for faster releases.
* Scalability: Enabled easy scaling to handle increased demand.
* Improved Efficiency: Reduced manual intervention and improved operational efficiency.
